	<p class="fs-5">
		Established in 1986, the <strong>New England Chinese Youth Summer Camp (NECYSC)</strong> is a non-profit summer camp dedicated to 
		providing cultural enrichment and fostering community spirit for Chinese-American youth. Hosted at Brandeis University in 
		Waltham, MA, our week-long summer camp serves children ages 6 to 15, offering a
		<a class="programslink" href="/programs/" style="color: #4e598c;">variety of engaging programs, including 
				Day Camp, Overnight Camp, and ExplorAsian.</a>
	</p>
	<p class="fs-5">
		Our mission is to inspire a deep appreciation for Chinese/Taiwanese culture through activities like traditional Chinese arts classes, cultural workshops, and counselor-led events. With the support of dedicated parents and volunteers, we create a fun and safe environment where campers build lifelong friendships, strengthen leadership skills, and develop a strong sense of cultural pride and community.

	<p class="fs-5">
		From the planning stages to day-to-day operations, NECYSC thrives because of the incredible contributions from our parent volunteers.

	<p class="fs-5">
		We believe that a successful camp is one that involves the whole family, and we ask that all parents of the <a href="/programs/#day" class="text-purple">Overnight and ExplorAsian programs</a> contribute some of their time during the camp season. This helps us maintain the <strong>high standard of care, safety, and fun</strong> that we aim to provide each year.

					The POD program (Parent On Duty) is a key component of NECYSC and provides a structure for parents to contribute directly to the smooth running of camp. Whether it’s helping with laundry, volunteering for POD tasks, assisting with administrative work, or taking part in special projects, every little bit of effort makes a big difference.
